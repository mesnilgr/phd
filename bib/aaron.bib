     abstract = {Deep architectures have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in a variety of
settings, especially with vision datasets. Deep learning algorithms are based on learning
several levels of representation of the input. Beyond test-set performance, there
is a need for qualitative comparisons of the solutions learned by various deep architectures,
focused on those learned representations. One of the goals of our research
is to improve tools for finding good qualitative interpretations of high level features
learned by such models. We also seek to gain insight into the invariances learned by
deep networks. To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques for finding
such interpretations. We applied our techniques on Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders
and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that consistent
filter-like interpretation is possible and simple to accomplish at the unit level. The tools
developed make it possible to analyze deep models in more depth and accomplish the
tracing of invariance manifolds for each of the hidden units. We hope that such techniques
will allow researchers in deep architectures to understand more of how and why
deep architectures work.}
